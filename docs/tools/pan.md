# Pan Tool

The Pan tool can be accessed in the toolbar on the bottom right of the screen, regardless of [mode](/docs/tools-overview/#tools-and-modes).
When this tool is selected you can dag the screen around when you hold down your mouse while moving it.

There is not much more to it than that! *But* because you need it very often and don't want to constantly switch between the select and pan tools, PlanarAlly also binds the middle mouse button as a direct pan tool regardless of which tool you actually have active.

This results in me actually never using the pan tool as the active tool bar tool, unless I'm on a touchpad.
