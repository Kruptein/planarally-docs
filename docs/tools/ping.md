# Ping Tool

The Ping tool can be accessed in the toolbar on the bottom right of the Game Board, but only in [`Play` mode](/docs/tools-overview/#tools-and-modes).

It serves as a barebones "beacon" tool that, while the mouse is pressed down and held, shows two circles to all players where your mouse currently is.

The ping circles use the same colour as your ruler colour from your [client settings](/docs/player/settings/).
