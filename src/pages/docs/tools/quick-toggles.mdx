# Quick Toggles

The DM toolbar has some extra icons below it. These are quick toggles that are useful for a variety of things.

<Image src={QuickTogglesImage} width={150} alt="Overview of the initiative tool" />

## Fake Player

When this is enabled the DM's screen will be rendered as if they are in fake player mode (See [Fake Player](/docs/dm/settings/#fake-player))

## Line of Sight

This quick toggle only shows up if you have [Line of Sight](/docs/dm/settings/#only-los) enabled.

It allows you to disable LoS **only** on your own screen. Just like the Fake Player toggle, this helps with verifying light & vision setups during prep work.
It will show green when LOS is enabled and red when it's (temporarily) disabled.

In particular when working on a new location where you likely have no shapes with vision access ready you can use this to verify lights you setup without having to create temporary shapes.

## Initiative

The initiative quick toggle is compared to the other toggles more than a convenience.
When enabled it will turn green (until clicked again) and indicates that [initiative](/docs/tools/initiative/) is active.

It will automatically open the initiative UI for all players and will activate some of the [Initiative settings](/docs/game/settings/#initiative).
These settings are only active when initiative is explicitly enabled using this toggle!
