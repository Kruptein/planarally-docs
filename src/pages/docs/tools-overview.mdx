# Tools Overview

PlanarAlly provides a set of tools to interact with the Game Board and other players.
GMs are provided with some additional tools suitable for their needs.
Most, but not all, of these tools are accessible via a toolbar at the bottom right of the Game Board.

## Toolbar and Modes

To limit the toolbar being flooded with a lot of options, tools are shown depending on a toolbar-mode.
Currently there are 2 modes "Play" and "Build", the former focusing on tools that are actually used during play
and the latter on tools mostly used during DM prep.

To switch modes you can click on the desired mode or use the `Tab` key.

Below is an overview of all tools and in which mode they are available.
Note that some tools might have altered behaviour depending on the mode.
