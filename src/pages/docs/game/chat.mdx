# __Chat__ 
[@veritanuda](https://keybase.io/veritanuda)

In game chat is now possible by simply clicking the `Chat` button in the bottom left of the viewport window.

When a chat message is sent by any user then a number of unread messages will appear next to the button.

The chat window accepts Markdown input meaning styles and links can be included as well as more advanced formatting. See the [Markdown Tutorial](../../../learn/dm/Markdown_Tutorial/markdown)

The chat is ***ephemeral*** meaning the current chat session will only exist in that context window. Should for any reason you refresh the page the chat history will be lost to you.
