# Assets

<Image src="/docs/dashboard-assets.png" width={800} aspectRatio={1898 / 963} alt="Dashboard Assets" />

The **Assets** section offers you to manage or create assets that can be used in campaigns.
_See the [DM assets](/docs/dm/assets/) section to learn how to use them_.

<Info>
    Currently assets are only interesting for the DM. In the future this should also become a place where players can
    upload assets.
</Info>

The top-right offers a small action-bar allowing you to create a folder, upload new assets or remove the active selection.

## Navigating the folders

The main screen offers you a folder-explorer where you can doubleclick to go into a folder.
Your current folder-path is displayed with a breadcrumb just below the 'MANAGE ASSETS' title.

To go back to the previous folder you can doubleclick the ".." folder[^1].
You can also click on any segment of the breadcrumb to go back multiple folders at once.

## Uploading assets

Assets can be uploaded either by clicking on the add file icon in the action bar or by dragging the assets onto the asset manager.

## Moving assets

You can move assets around by dragging them to the desired folder.
So when you want to move an asset a folder up, drag it over the ".." folder.

You can move multiple assets at once, either by dragging a folder containing multiple assets or by selecting multiple assets.

## Selecting assets

Single clicking an asset will select it and deselect all other assets.

If you want to extend the selection you can either ctrl+click or shift+click.
The former will add just the clicked file to the selection,
whereas the latter will add every file between the last selection and the new selection.

<Info>
    The current behaviour is a left-over from the previous asset-manager and mimicks common file-explorer semantics.

    The way selection is currently shown however, makes this a bit unintuitive.
    So this might change in the future.
