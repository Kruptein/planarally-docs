This is a short article about the vision state in its current form and some changes I intend to do,
to make some of it actually more straightforward.

Rest assured, the changes I want to do aren't big, they're rather subtle changes but I still felt that it deserved some separate article as vision is usually the core of gameplay.

## How it currently works

There is in-depth documentation on the lighting system over [here](/docs/dm/lighting-vision/#lighting--vision), but a short summary is as follows:

When the board is filled with fog (DM setting: fill with FOW), everything is hidden for the player.
Any shape that has an aura marked as public and as a light source however will appear to the player.
Light sources not marked as public will only show up if the player has vision access to the shape.

An extra vision setting can be enabled: line of sight (DM setting: LoS).
With this enabled, players will only be able to see the aforementioned light sources if they have vision access over a shape that is explicitly marked as "is a token".
Even more so, they'll only see the part of those lightsources that falls within their vision (taking walls and other vision blocking shapes into account).
So you don't see whatever is behind the corner even if it's lit.

## What are the problems?

So what is wrong with this. Not a whole lot to be honest, but a few things stand out after using it for a while.

- The `is a token` setting is quite unintuitive, it's impact is not directly clear
- It's also very easy to forget, potentially giving some confusion/frustration at the table (e.g. "No, I can't see anything")
- The meaning of the vision access right becomes equally confusing in combination with the `is token` property
- As a DM you can sometimes have a wrong picture of what players might be able to see (more on this later)

## Rethinking the token concept

This ultimately made me think about the core idea behind the token concept. Why was it originally introduced?

The answer to that question is rather simple: performance.

Calculating the vision of shapes is one of the more intensive things that PA needs to do, and as a player you only own 1 or maybe a couple shapes so it's not that big of a deal,
but the DM technically owns all shapes in the scene, which can end up being a lot of shapes.
As such the token property was introduced to limit vision calculation only to those shapes that were marked as such, relieving the DM renderside heavily.

Taking a step back however, this solution is actually kinda backwards.
For players the solution is relatively straightforward.
If they have access over a shape, they're likely to also require vision over what the shape can see.
And a DM ultimately (usually) only cares about what the players can actually see.

So can't we just drop the `is a token` concept and instead just check if the shape has a player with vision access attached to it?

To answer that question we first need to confirm our hypothesis: Do players require vision over all the shapes they own?

There are broadly speaking three different kind of shapes that a player might have access to:

- Shapes that represent some character / player token
- Shapes that represent something like a summon / pet / npc / other companion
- Shapes that represent objects (e.g. spell effects, drawn shapes that represent obstructions..)

The first shape should by all means in 99% of the cases give some form of vision as it represents the player's character fundamentally.
The second shape however is already problematic however. The answer here is "it depends".
For the last shape though the answer is in 99% of the cases no. There is no reason why the rectangle you drew to represent some barricade should give you vision,
if anything it should actually block vision!

So our hypothesis is sadly not true, so we can't drop the `is a token` property after all ?

Not so fast! The attentive reader may have noticed that so far we've often referred to "vision access", which might imply there are other _accesses_?

It turns out there are. PA has 3 levels of access that gradually increase permissions.
Vision access gives you access to all private light/vision sources the shape has,
Movement access adds the ability to move the token to that and finally Edit access gives you the ability to modify properties/auras/... of the shape.

If we look back at our 4 examples, we would likely want all 3 access levels for the first shape, but only edit access and maybe movement to the second shape.
Something like a pet/summon might have stats or some other things that the player should have control over, they might be able to move it, but usually they won't have vision access.

This is currently not possible as PA assumes that these are additive permissions. But we can break this up in complete standalone permissions instead.

## A solution at last

So if we break up the access levels, drop the token property and instead just look at the "vision access" the player has.. we succeed!

So to recap the changes I'm likely going to make:

- Make the 3 access levels independent instead of stacking on top of each other
- Remove the `is token` property
- Decide shape vision state based on the vision access level

## The DM side of things

As I mentioned earlier there can be some confusion in the DM side of things when dealing with vision.
Generally the DM can see all the players' vision combined and can deselect certain views with the vision tool.

Private vision auras that are not associated with a player however end up giving funky effects.
They will show up to the DM as the DM technically has access to every shape, so the private auras apply to the DM as well.
These are however auras that will never show up to the player, so showing them in the DM's view is kind of strange.

With the changes described above this particular "bug" will also be gone.

It does add a new challenge however, if the `is token` is gone, how do you prepare a new map where the players are not yet in the location.
You could in theory add a random player to a test shape to check if your lighting is set up correctly.
You could also just configure the default vision access right of the shape.
Both approaches work, though you'll have to pay extra attention that you don't forget to remove this again when your players are ready to explore the location.

I think we can do better here. When preparing a map you usually don't actually care about the Line of Sight aspect, that's more of a playtime constraint for the players.
The light & wall setup itself is all we really care about during prep. One could manually toggle the Line of Sight setting during prep and play, but that's quite cumbersome.
The various game parameters (e.g. line of sight) should be constant. It's the DM environment that should be configurable.

I see some options here:

- Auto disable LoS for the DM, enable it when you activate fake-player mode
- Add a new quick toggle below the toolbar that toggles LoS on/off **only** for the DM
- Add a new quick toggle to enable "prep" mode. In this mode the campaign is auto-locked (i.e. players can't join) and some specific settings are active (e.g. LoS is turned off)

The first option is going to be unintuitive I think, as you don't see an immediate change upon turning on the LoS DM setting, whereas it actually has a big effect.
The second option feels good and is probably what I'm going to go for.
I find the third option intriguing, but it's going to be something that is not going to work for everybody.
I think instead that the lock-mode might also become a quick toggle actually.
And at one point I'll probably make it configurable which toggles are visible if you don't use all of them.
