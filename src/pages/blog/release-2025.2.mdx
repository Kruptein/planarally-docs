import Warning from "/src/components/directives/Warning.astro";

This release has a couple of things going on:

- The server's config format was completely changed
- A mailserver can now be configured by the server admin, allowing a 'forgot password' flow
- The isToken property has been removed and shape access now works differenty
- Experimental mod support has gotten some improvements
- Follow up on the reworked in-game asset manager from the last release

<Warning title="Server config change">
    If you're a server owner, the server config was changed drastically and requires manual intervention, see below for
    more info!
</Warning>

## Mail

This was long overdue, but server owners can now configure mail server information in the (new) config.
When configured PA will be able to use it to send out mails to players.

There is currently only one use for it, but it's an important one: forgot password flow.

### Forgot Password

When mail is configured the login screen will now show a "forgot password?" action under the password label,
providing a flow to reset the password for a given email address.

Note that this only works if the user has an email configured (note that email is optional during registration).

A small tangential QoL update is that a success notification will now appear when you modify your email address in the dashboard.
It was not super clear that something actually was modified when you did so until now.

## Disable LoS rendering

As a DM you might be familiar with the case where you're working on a new location and have configured a bunch of lights,
but aren't sure if they actually cover what you expect them to cover because you have LoS enabled and your players are still on another location.

There are a variety of "hacks" around this: creating a temporary shape with vision permissions, temporarily disabling LoS in the location settings, ...

They all work, but tend to be a hassle or even error prone (e.g. forgetting to turn the LoS setting back on when you're ready for your players to visit the location).

That's why there is now a new quick toggle under the toolbar for DMs titled 'LOS'.
It's only visible if LoS is enabled in the location.
It has a green (on) and red (off) mode that can be used to override the LoS setting purely on your local client.

This allows you to quickly toggle the behaviour on/off without it impacting players, making level design easier.

## Access levels & isToken

Every shape in PA has access levels that can be finetuned per player. Allowing some players full edit control over a shape and others only vision access.

Up until now these access levels (vision/movement/edit) were additive. Every access level also gave all permissions related to the access levels below it (e.g. movement also included vision permissions).
This has worked fine as a baseline for the majority of PA's existence, but I recently encountered some problems I wanted to tackle that were not possible due to this additive nature.

Access levels are now completely separate. For example it's now possible to have edit access without vision access. This can be useful if a player has control over some pet's stats, but can't see what the pet can see.

Additionally every shape also had a special property `isToken`. This was essential for vision calculation when LoS is enabled and something that all player shapes had to have enabled.
This property is however not super intuitive to most new players and even some veterans aren't super sure on what it actually does, except that they need to enable it for LoS.

This was introduced for performance reasons way back, but after some thinking time, I figured out that it's actually not needed if I modify how the access levels work.
The result is that the `isToken` property has been removed, it's no longer needed to manually tag user shapes with this.
Instead any shape that your user has vision access to, will be rendered as if it had isToken in the past.

I wrote an [extended blog post](https://www.planarally.io/blog/removing-is-token/) about the reasons why these changes were made if you want some more info.

## Assets

The dashboard asset manager has dedicated create-folder/upload-file/remove-selection buttons, which the in-game version did not have.
Adding files and selection removal were still possible through mouse drag&drop and context menus, but folder creation was just not possible.

These buttons are now also present in the in-game asset manager.

## Mod updates

_Please note that mod support is still very experimental_

A year ago early support for mods was added. This was still very rough, with one big problem being that only the server owner could add mods by manualy adding them to a specific folder.
This release adds a UI per campaign, allowing the DM to upload mods used for that specific campaign.

Additionally a lot of the internals of the mod API have been updated, in particularly the DataBlock API received some drastic changes, making the mod UI side ofthings way compacter.

For more info, I'm deferring to the PR:

All example mods in the planarally-mods repo have also been updated to the new API.
