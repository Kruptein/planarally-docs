# Reverse proxy

Commonly when hosting a server, you use some reverse proxy to shield your actual server from the outside world.
This page provides a set of examples for some popular proxies. Note that some of these have been contributed and not tested/verified by the PA author.

Note that PA can run either in host:port mode or in socket mode. Most proxies can handle either, the examples will usually use one of the two.

A last note is that most examples will have some hardcoded things that you'll have to change. (e.g. "app.planarally.io" is used as the example hostname).

<Warning title="Websocket">
PA is generally a very normal web server, it however requires websocket connections.
This can depending on the proxy be a bit more setup.

If you can visit the main PA homepage, but not upload assets or do anything useful in a game, the connection to the websocket most likely is the culprit.
Either your proxy setup is faulty, or you have cors issues. For the latter double check that the [cors config setting](/server/management/configuration/#field-cors_allowed_origins) is configured correctly

</Warning>

## Caddy

All you need is this:

_Assumes the PA socket is at `/run/pa.sock`. (this is just an example)_

```apache
app.planarally.io {
  handle {
    reverse_proxy unix//run/pa.sock
  }
}
```

Caddy handles the websocket stuff automatically.
It also does letsencrypt certificates out of the box.

## Nginx

When using nginx you need to explicitly setup websocket forwarding.

Following is an example config that mimicks my old config (before I changed to caddy).
The important part is that the sockets are passed through.

This uses a socket setup, if you use a host:port combo, drop the upstream section and just put them in the proxy_pass directly.

```nginx
server {
    listen *:443;
    ssl on;
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/planarally.io/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/planarally.io/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot

    server_name app.planarally.io;

    location / {
      proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      proxy_redirect off;
      proxy_buffering off;
      proxy_pass http://pa_sock;
    }

    location /socket.io/ {
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_pass http://pa_sock/socket.io/;
    }

    location /static {
      alias /home/darragh/dev/planarally/server/;
    }

    location ~ /.well-known {
      allow all;
      root /var/www/letsencrypt;
    }
}

upstream pa_sock {
  server unix:/tmp/planarally.sock fail_timeout=0;
}
```

## Apache

The following apache configuration expects the PlanarAlly application server running on port 8008 on the same machine as the proxy.
It assumes that you have generated SSL/TLS certificates and private keys at the locations specified in `SSLCertificateFile/SSLCertificateKeyFile`.
All HTTP requests will be redirected to HTTPS.
Replace `planarally.CHANGEME.org` with the actual domain name on which PlanarAlly will be made available.

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName planarally.CHANGEME.org
    # Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
    RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:443>
  ServerName  planarally.CHANGEME.org
  SSLEngine on
  SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/planarally.CHANGEME.org.crt
  SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/planarally.CHANGEME.org.key
  ProxyPreserveHost On
  ProxyRequests off
  ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8008/
  ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8008/
  RewriteEngine on
  RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]
  RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} upgrade [NC]
  RewriteRule ^/?(.*) "ws://127.0.0.1:8008/$1" [P,L]
</VirtualHost>
```

## Traefik

Here is an example configuration using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and
[traefik](https://containo.us/traefik/), a docker reverse proxy manager. This is assuming that your
traefik external network is named `web` as well.

#### docker-compose.yml

It is important to note the changes needed to `domain.com` to match your domain and to the paths to both
the `assets` and `data` folders. These volumes can be whatever you please.

```yaml
---
version: "3"

networks:
    traefik_network:
        external:
            name: web

services:
    # Media Server

            - "traefik.http.middlewares.sslheader.headers.customrequestheaders.X-Forwarded-Proto=https"
            # these are required, this forces the websocket to forward over https
            - "traefik.http.routers.pa.middlewares=ssl-header"
            - "traefik.http.middlewares.ssl-header.headers.customrequestheaders.X-Forwarded-Proto=https"
```
