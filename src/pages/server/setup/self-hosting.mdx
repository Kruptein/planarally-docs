# Self-hosting

## General Info

Hosting PlanarAlly yourself requires a bit more setup then simply using an existing service, but it does give you more control and you can rely on it working offline as well.

To host PlanarAlly yourself you have four options:

- Build the client manually and run the server
- Run the server using a pre-built client
- Use a docker container
- Use a precompiled executable

The first 2 require you to manually install some things (e.g. python, dependencies, ...).\
Docker allows you to skip a bunch of the manual work, but requires understanding of containers and volumes.

Lastly a .exe is available for people who are not super technical. It should get the job done, but it's less tested.

### Versions

Depending on the chosen option you can decide which version of PA you want to use.

For production versions you can find the official releases [here](https://github.com/Kruptein/PlanarAlly/releases).\
For a development version you can just check-out any git commit/branch and manually build it.\
For all releases as well as the development branch, docker images are automatically published on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kruptein/planarally/tags).

### Backups and Upgrades

When backing up your data three folders are important (relative to the server folder):

- data
- static/assets
- static/mods

If you made changes to the config (`data/config.toml`) some other folders/files might need to be backed up as well.

When upgrading PA, a migration to the save file (default location `data/planar.sqlite`) might occur. A backup of the current save file will be done to the `save_backups` folder.

<Info>
If you install PA using one of the release zips/tarballs (e.g. you extract a folder somewhere), it's generally recommended to extract these to a new location and move/copy the above 3 data folders.
<br />
Extracting over the existing installation will usually work, but it can sometimes lead to some subtle bugs where a file was removed in the codeabse, but will not be removed by overwriting.
<br />
When using git/docker this does not apply.

</Info>

### Configuration

It's normal that you don't find a config file. PA uses default values that are stored internally.
To override some of these options you can create a `config.toml` file in the server's `data` folder to change the configuration.

See the [config docs](/server/management/configuration/) for the details.

By default PA will run on port 8000, so if everything went successfull regardless of chosen host option, you should be able to see PA at http://localhost:8000

## Fully manual installation

PA consists of two parts:

- a server written in python
- a frontend written in typescript

While you will always need to run the server to use PA, you only need to re-build the client if you download/change the PA version.

### Frontend

To build the frontend you need `node` and `npm` installed. At the moment of writing at least version 22 of node is required.

```bash
# You need to be in the client folder to get the client working!
cd client
# Update dependencies, a new version usually comes with new dependencies
npm i
# Build the server
npm run build
```

This will convert the typescript files to a couple minified javascript files and places them in the server's static folder, so that the server can be ran.

That's all!

### Backend

You need a recent version of python installed to run PA. I believe 3.11 is the minimum version, but it's officially tested against 3.13.

You can use any method to install python, but the recommended route is by using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
This will cleanly seperate python installs and is also incredibly fast. Additionally this is used for dependency management by PA itself.

<Info title="Dependencies without uv">
If you don't want or can't use uv, it should be noted that there is no `requirements.txt` file in the repository.
PA uses the modern `pyproject.toml` file which uv (as well as other tools) understand.

This means however that you can't do a traditional `pip install -r requirements.txt`. You can find the list of dependencies you need to install in the aforementioned `pyproject.toml` file

</Info>

The following instructions assume you use uv, adapt the commands to your need if you use another approach.

```bash
# 1. Install python (can be skipped if you already have this)
uv python install 3.13
# 2. Move to the server folder!
# (if you're still in the client folder you need to use `cd ../server`!)
cd server
# 3. Create a virtual environment for your python install
uv venv
# 4. Install the dependencies
uv sync
# 5. Run PA
uv run planarally.py
```

When you want to (re)start your server in the future you only need to run step 5.
If you changed the version of PA you also need to rerun step 4.

## Pre-built client

If you want to manage the server install, but don't want to bother with building the client you can use the pre-built client files.
These appear as the `Planarally-bin` files in the releases.

These only have a server folder, you can follow the same steps as the fully manual installation above, but skip all the frontend/client related steps.

## Docker Container

### Vanilla

You can grab the [Official Container](https://hub.docker.com/r/kruptein/planarally) with this command.  
`docker pull kruptein/planarally`

There are 3 volumes that should be mounted to have data persistency:

- data: This is where the configuration as well as the save file usually is stored
- assets: This is where user uploaded assets are stored
- mods: This is an optional volume, only required if you allow/use mods on the server.

It's recommended to make explicit volumes for these with `docker volume create` (See https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/)

PA runs as a limited user in the docker container, you need to change the ownership of the created volumes to match this:

```
cd /var/lib/docker/volumes
sudo chown -R 9000:9000 data/
# repeat for other volumes
```

With volumes set up, you're ready to actually run the container.

```
# PA runs on port 8000, You can drop the mods volume if you don't intend to use it or allow it
# It's generally recommended to specify a particular tag of the docker image (e.g. v2025.2.2) instead of using the latest
# New versions can come with database migrations and might require some manual intervention that you want to do when you have some time
docker run -d -t -p 8000:8000 -v data:/planarally/data/ -v assets:/planarally/static/assets/ -v mods:/planarally/static/mods --name planarally kruptein/planarally
```

### compose

There is currently no official docker-compose file, but a member of the community once wrote [this guide](https://github.com/edmael/selfhosted-planarally) on using docker-compose, ssl and nginx.

There is also a compose file included in an example setup made for the Traefik reverse proxy, which can be found [here](/server/advanced/proxy/#traefik).

## Precompiled executable

_Note that the version numbers that are part of the releases' file names, are omitted in this tutorial._

To run PlanarAlly on Windows, download the `planarally-windows.zip` from the release page and extract it somewhere in a new folder.

This folder contains a lot of different files, but the important one for you right now is the one titled `planarally.exe`.
When you execute this file, a command prompt will appear (a black screen with some text).

<Warning>
    It's healthy to be wary of random executables on the internet. These `.exe` files are generated using Nuitka from
    the python source code in an isolated CI environment.

    Nevertheless it can happen that a false-positive is triggered by an antivirus vendor out there for various reasons.

</Warning>

## Development

You can configure the client and server to run in a special development mode. This way the frontend is hot-reloaded (i.e. changes made are immediately applied without needing a rebuild).

This requires the server to be ran with the additional 'dev' argument:

```bash
uv run planarally.py dev
```

Additionally this also requires a separate process that handles the client hot-reloading

```bash
# in the client folder
npm run dev
```

Note that although the client output will mention a port, you should just use the server port like you would for normal non-development use of PA.
