# External Services

By far the easiest option regarding setup is the use of an online service that provides PlanarAlly to you and your players.

At this point in time I do not have the resources to publicly host a PlanarAlly server, but this might be something I would like to add further down the road.

<Warning>
    These services are **not** operated by me and thus I cannot guarantee that the software has not been altered with
    malicious intent.
